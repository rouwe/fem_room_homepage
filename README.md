## My process

I started by diving the page into smaller sections and tackling each one at a time. Starting at the top to bottom while adding some functionality using vanilla JavaScript when an interaction is required. I also used a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox for laying out things.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This allows me to improve my layout and grid manipulation skills. It also helps me solidify the fundamentals of javascript DOM manipulation. I also added a feature that keeps track of viewport and changes the image source used on slider for mobile or desktop.

### Continued development

I will be focusing more on fundamentals of creating a website.
